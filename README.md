# IPchexmex
Checks to see if you are in a country that allows Bitmex trading

Finally through trial and error, the IpChexMex_nopermreq branch no longer has access to the page data (I hated seeing that it required access to all content on BitMex before. I only need the url haha). Now it only has access to tab information (url, tab title, etc.).
