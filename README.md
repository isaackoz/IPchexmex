# IPchexmex
Checks to see if you are in a country that allows Bitmex trading

When you visit bitmex.com/\*, it will use geoiplookup.io to get your ip ocation. It then runs a check against the prohibited countries ( plus Quebec) to see if your ip is in a country that BitMex prohibits trading on. While a tab with BitMex is open, it will check every 60 seconds to see if you are safe. 

Can be found in the Chrome store under username: "isaackoz" titled "IPchexmex".

Only bug so far is that if you go to a different url while previously on a bitmex url (bitmex.com -> google.com) in the same tab, it will still run every 60 seconds to see if you are safe. You can fix this by either closing the tab that previously was on bitmex, or wait for me to fix it. 

As always,
